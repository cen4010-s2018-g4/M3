# Detailed Requirements and Architecture


## 1. Executive Summary

University students who reside on campus indulge in the various social activities and events the campus has to offer. However, they're 
also exposed to all of the issues that arise throughout the campus. The goal of this project is to create a centralized web application 
where students, as well as, faculty, staff and visitors can connect to post about any events taking place around campus. Our team will 
be developing the web application “Campus Snapshots” to serve this purpose. 

Campus Snapshots will be an application which could be accessed through a personal computer or mobile device using all major browsers 
like, Safari and Google Chrome. The main purpose of this application will be to serve as a place where individuals can report instant 
snapshots of any issues happening around campus such as, leakage in a classroom, broken A/C, etc. These real time snapshots will consist 
of images or videos along with a description and will appear instantly on our web page in order to alert university administrators of the 
problems that need fixing. Administrators will then be responsible for verifying if the claims are accurate and providing status updates 
for these claims until they are resolved. 

Due to the various social activities that take place around campus, our website will also serve as a means of sharing posts about fun 
events. People can interact by commenting on each other's posts and having the ability to share posts with friends. In order to ensure 
a safe online environment, we will require users to register for personal accounts to be able to add/delete their posts and chat with 
friends and/or administrators. Other features like checking for the weather and searching for specific events within the site will be 
implemented in order to create a better user experience. Ultimately, we plan to develop a user friendly and easy to navigate site that 
will aid in keeping our university in great shape while providing a means for everyone to communicate and engage with one another.


## 2. Competitive Analysis

*Site Comparison Table Image
  
Campus Snapshots will have the ability to upload instant images and videos like our competitors, Instagram and Snapchat. We will use a fluid chat system, implement content monitoring and use a system to block/ban false comments and contents similar to Facebook. Students will also be able to search for events and friends. However, we will add a weather system to alert students of major environmental threats which isn’t an option offered by any of our competitors.
